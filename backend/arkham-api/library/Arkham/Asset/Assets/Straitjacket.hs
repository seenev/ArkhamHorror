-- Ability is usable by investigators at the same location due to this "ruling" from MJ:
--
-- > Story-assets are kind of their own weird thing. They have a player card
-- > type but are also considered to be scenario cards. While they are controlled
-- > by a player (or in a playerâ€™s deck or hand), they function like any other
-- > asset, and are considered to be player cards. While they are not under a
-- > playerâ€™s control, they function like scenario cards. Depending on the
-- > scenario, they may have either a player card back (like Lita Chantler) or an
-- > encounter card back. Which kind of card back they have doesnâ€™t really make a
-- > difference here; it just affects which deck they might appear in.
