      \ disheveled room, trying to make sense of what\
      \ you’d just experienced. You had awoken that\
      \ afternoon with a violent startle, your body shaking, bedsheets soaked\
      \ with sweat. Although you’d slept a healthy eight-and-a-half hours, you\
      \ feel even more exhausted than you had the previous night. You catch a\
      \ glimpse of your dark, bloodshot eyes in the mirror next to the dresser,\
      \ and wonder if you’ve gotten any real sleep at all."

      \ like a prison, but the man—Daniel—he seemed unhinged, as though\
      \ he wasn’t in control of his mind. This led to only one conclusion: An\
      \ asylum. Knowing you’ll get little rest here, you head towards Arkham\
      \ Asylum, hoping your hunch is correct."

      \ Daniel Chesterfield, a stagehand during the previous production of\
      \ The King in Yellow. As far as you can tell, he is the only surviving\
      \ member of that production’s cast and crew. The rest of them—that is,\
      \ those for whom you can find any records at all—disappeared or died\
      \ soon after opening night in a variety of fashions connected only by their\
      \ morbidness. Freak accidents. Suicides. Vanishings."

      \ Arkham Asylum many years ago. All documentation about Daniel’s\
      \ treatment seems to end there. You’re unsure if he’s even still alive.\
      \ Perhaps he was cured and released. You were hoping to avoid this, but\
      \ there seems to be only one way to find out. You collect your belongings\
      \ and head downtown, towards Arkham Asylum."

      \ he pores through his file cabinet, eventually pulling out a stark white\
      \ folder. Inside is a wealth of information about the patients admitted\
      \ to the asylum—medical records, psychiatric evaluations, and the like.\
      \ You recognize a few of the faces as he flips through the pages. “Daniel…\
      \ Daniel Chesterfield, yes? He is admitted under the special care of\
      \ Doctor Mintz. But you can’t see him; his level is restricted to staff only.”\

      \ must hold the key to understanding what is really going on."

      \ security guards nearby. “Oh, of course, of course,” he says with all\
      \ the honesty of a street peddler. “I will schedule a meeting for you\
      \ with Doctor Mintz so you can speak with him about Daniel. These\
      \ gentlemen will see you in.” Relieved that you will soon get the answers\
      \ you seek, you are escorted into the patient wing of Arkham Asylum…"

      \ Engram, to take some kind of oath. At first, she’d written it off as the\
      \ whim of an eccentric artist; something Mr. Engram did as a strange\
      \ formality to unite and strengthen the bonds of the cast and crew. And\
      \ to his credit, she claimed that it had worked; ever since they’d taken his\
      \ strange oath, she and the other members of the troupe felt much more\
      \ confident and full of spirit. Perhaps Daniel had a similar experience\
      \ during the last production of The King in Yellow. You must speak with\
      \ him about this."
