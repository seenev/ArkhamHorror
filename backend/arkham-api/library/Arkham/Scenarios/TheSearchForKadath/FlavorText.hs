      \ ascend to such a place would be bitter indeed. My companion Barzai once\
      \ scaled a peak only a fraction as sacred, and he was never seen nor heard\

      \ offering draught after draught to the priest. Eventually, Atal’s lips\

      \ not for the wine. He tells of an image carved into the face of the mountain\
      \ Ngranek on the isle of Oriab—the likeness of the gods, or so he claims. He\
      \ tells of the pillars of Kadatheron wherein the history of Earth’s\
      \ Dreamlands is recorded. He tells of those slain by the hordes of Night\
      \ itself and interred in the crypts of Zulan-Thek, the city of the dead. He\
