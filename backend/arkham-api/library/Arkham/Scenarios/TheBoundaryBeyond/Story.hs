      \ several days since you hit the road from Arkham on your way to Mexico City,\
      \ where you may be able to get answers from some of Alejandro’s associates—or\
      \ even better, from his adversaries in academia. Your recent investigations in\
      \ Arkham uncovered much, but despite all the knowledge you laid bare, the trail\
      \ went cold soon after. The “Brotherhood” that you exposed in Arkham has all but\
      \ vanished from the city. Its members left behind little information as to their\
      \ next objective, other than the name “The Nexus of N’kai,” a place of power that\
      \ Ichtaca believes is the Brotherhood’s ultimate destination. Enigmatic as ever,\
      \ the Eztli warrior sits in the passenger seat next to you. She is tense and\
      \ coiled like a spring, the Ford’s leather seat offering her little comfort."

      \ He remains huddled in the back seat of the car, his knees keeping the journal\
      \ still, his brows furrowed in thought. “This ‘Brotherhood’ is the least of our\
      \ concerns,” he says with an air of finality. “I’ve been trying to decrypt the\
      \ glyphs the device bears. The symbols are clearly not Aztec, nor Mayan, nor are\
      \ they from any other Mesoamerican civilization, for that matter. I believe there\
      \ is some other place the relic belongs. Somewhere it was taken from. Wouldn’t\
      \ you agree, Miss Ichtaca?”"

      \ bother to turn around in her seat before addressing Alejandro. “It belongs\
      \ somewhere meddlesome scholars cannot abuse its power,” she replies in a cold\
      \ tone, and that is the end of the discussion."
    , "Crossing the border into Mexico is a less stressful endeavor than you imagined\
      \ it to be, due to Alejandro’s connections. You are waved through customs with\

      \ find any of Alejandro’s former colleagues in the city, and even his enemies\
      \ refuse to speak to you, save for one: a woman named Padma Amrita, who studied\
      \ Alejandro’s work before he came to Arkham. She agrees to meet you at a trendy\
      \ lounge in the southern part of the city, late at night. Ichtaca remains a short\
      \ distance away, observing your new informant silently."
    , "Padma knows a lot about Alejandro’s research, and even claims to have heard of\
      \ the Nexus of N’kai, though she refuses to tell you how to find it. “It is a\
      \ fool’s errand,” she tells you. “There is nothing to find. Just a myth. Trust\
      \ me, many have searched for it. None have found it.” You point out that the\
      \ Eztli people were not a myth, and she responds with a charming smile. “Perhaps\
      \ not, but all this about the Eztli still being alive? Undiscovered for\
      \ centuries?” She laughs heartily. “Bushwa, pure and simple. Come now, you don’t\
      \ expect real scholars to believe that, do you?” Your eyes are drawn to Ichtaca,\
      \ who is overhearing the conversation with crossed arms, her nails dug into her\
      \ forearms. Padma’s eyes wander over as well, the hint of a smirk on her lips.\
      \ “In any event, I apologize, but I don’t have any information for you. Only a\
      \ sap would continue this ‘research’ any further. Good day.” Padma leaves with\
      \ another alluring smile, a sweet scent trailing behind her as she departs."
    , "Once she is out of sight, Ichtaca sits down next to you, and you discuss your\
      \ next move. After a week of failure after failure, she has grown impatient. You\
      \ offer a few more suggestions regarding whom you could speak to next, but her\
      \ mind is elsewhere. When you return to your hotel, she immediately retreats to\
      \ her room to make preparations for tomorrow. You decide to settle in for the\
      \ night, and before long, your mind is meandering hazily into a dreamless\
      \ slumber. In the far recesses of your awareness, however, you can hear Ichtaca\
      \ reciting a cryptic incantation..."

      \ Thin wisps of incense smoke fill the air."
    , "Rising to your feet requires a colossal effort. A small voice in the back of\

      \ the boundary, into the very threads of time. Perhaps you are more than you\
      \ seem,” she responds, the irony of her statement lost on her. Though she departs\
      \ without answering your question, you understand the answer that remains\
