      \ worship the ancient master of the ghouls. This cult has been killing innocent\
      \ people and feeding them to the ghouls, satiating a monstrous hunger. A dark\
      \ balance was maintained. Until now. Recently,” Lita continues, “one of their\
      \ lairs, where the corpses were stored, was destroyed. Since then, the ghouls have\
      \ been more active than usual. I have tracked their movements and tried my\
      \ best to stop them from running amok throughout the city. But I think there\
      \ is something worse going on. The cult has been planning something darker,\
      \ and more ominous, than anything I have yet observed. Indications are that\
      \ this plan shall come to fruition tonight, shortly after midnight. Beyond that, I\
      \ cannot fathom what to expect."

      \ their foul intentions. Whenever the cult meets, its members don masks shaped\
      \ like the skulls of various animals to protect their identities from one another.\
      \ These masks are our mark. Symbols of death and decay. We must unmask the\
      \ cultists to expose and derail their plans. We have but a few hours. The more\
      \ cultists we find before midnight, the better.”"
