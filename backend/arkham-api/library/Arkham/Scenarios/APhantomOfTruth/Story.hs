      \ and your companions have been investigating\
      \ the strange incidents that followed in its wake.\
      \ What you have found makes you question the wisdom of continuing\
      \ your investigation, but the truth calls out to you, and you cannot help\
      \ but answer. It seems you weren’t the first to piece together the strange\
      \ happenings surrounding The King in Yellow. Another group of\
      \ investigators had been researching these events as well. Just a matter\
      \ of days after the performance in Arkham, they were admitted to the\
      \ asylum, ranting about the King’s return and the “monsters” that had\
      \ attacked them. Somehow this doesn’t surprise you. Their fate makes\
      \ you all the more certain you are on the right trail... And all the more\
      \ certain that you should stop while you still have the chance."

      \ incarceration, and picked up the trail where they left off. They had\
      \ interviewed some of the cast and crew of The King in Yellow, and\
      \ discovered several pieces of vital information. Their research also\
      \ contains notes about their discoveries in Arkham’s Historical Society,\
      \ and accounts from their time spent in the asylum, including interactions\
      \ with a patient named “Daniel Chesterfield.” After a long night of\
      \ compiling and comparing notes, you fall into a deep slumber. In your\
      \ dreams, you are subjected to visions of Carcosa—its black stars, twin\
      \ suns, shattered moons, and twisted spires."
