    [ "You awaken with a start, as though shaken by an unseen force. You\
      \ must have slept for quite some time, for there are only a few other\
      \ patrons in the audience, and no performers on stage. The lights are\
      \ dimmed, and the stage curtains are tattered and ripped, though you\
      \ do not remember that being the case during the first act. You wait a\
      \ moment before you are sure this isn’t part of the performance. As you\
      \ wait, a foul but unrecognizable smell permeates the air. How long have\
      \ you been asleep? Shaking off your drowsiness, you walk toward one of\
      \ the seated patrons and ask for the time, but he does not respond. It is\
      \ then that you realize you are speaking to a corpse."

    [ "Once again you are startled awake, this time by\
      \ the cold, clammy fingers of a hand on your shoulder. “Are\
      \ you alright?” an elderly man asks, helping you to your feet.\
      \ Your mind is a flurry of memories. Last you remember, the\
      \ Ward Theatre had become a place of nightmares, filled with\
      \ dangerous fanatics and strange terrors. Worried, you glance\
      \ at your surroundings, only to find yourself on the rain-slicked\
      \ curb outside the theatre. Despite the events from earlier, the\
      \ city seems normal to your eyes—or at least, what passes as\
      \ normal for Arkham. The bright glare of headlights drills into\
      \ your eyes as cars pass on the street, splashing dirty rainwater\
      \ onto the sidewalk beside you. The old man wears an expression\
      \ of concern, noting the terror in your eyes. “Were you mugged?\
      \ Damn those trouble boys!” he exclaims. “Dry-gulching folk on\
      \ a night out to the the-a-tre! Not a single street those hooligans\
      \ haven’t staked a claim on, I tell you.”"
    , "You stand and walk over to the front window of the Ward\
      \ Theatre to tentatively peer through, but it is too dark to see\
      \ anything inside. The elderly man eyes you curiously for a\
      \ moment, then shrugs and continues walking. “Well, I’d best\
      \ be on my way. I would do the same, if I were you,” he says,\
      \ rounding the street corner. You quickly follow, hoping to warn\
      \ him to stay away from the theatre. But when you turn the\
      \ corner, it is not the elderly man you see, but the familiar sight\
      \ of the Stranger in his featureless, pallid mask. His unwavering\
      \ gaze bears down upon you. “Who are you?” you call out. The\
      \ Stranger does not respond, but instead turns and disappears\
      \ into the alleyway behind the theatre. You give chase, hoping for\
      \ answers, but by the time you reach the alleyway, it is empty—\
      \ save for a notice on the wall near the theatre’s employee\
      \ entrance. “Don’t be a wet blanket! Come to The King in\
      \ Yellow cast party. 8pm, at the home of Constance Dumaine,\
      \ 1452 Atlantic Avenue. Formal dress only.” You tear the notice\
      \ from the wall and take it with you, frustrated and lost."

    [ "Fleeing from the theatre, you head straight to\
      \ the police station in Easttown. Bursting through the door, to the\
      \ stares of onlookers and police officers alike, you demand to see\
      \ Sheriff Engle, stressing the importance of your visit. The desk\
      \ sergeant, who is lazily working through a stack of paperwork,\
      \ shakes his head and raises a finger in silence, then points to\
      \ a nearby chair. The wait is excruciating. Every moment is an\
      \ eternity. The hands of the nearby clock crawl. You drum your\
      \ fingers on the desk. You tap your feet. You constantly peer over\
      \ your shoulder to make sure the pallid mask of the Stranger is\
      \ not watching you through the front window. Finally, the desk\
      \ sergeant puts his pen down and sits up, beckoning you. “Alright,\
      \ what’s so important now?” You are only halfway through your\
      \ explanation of the night’s events when he sighs and shakes his\
      \ head. “Look, if this is some kind of joke, it ain’t funny,” he says.\
      \ “We had officers downtown all night. Don’t try to feed me some\
      \ hooey straight to my face.” You insist, but the desk sergeant\
      \ rises to his feet and opens the door, motioning for you to leave.\
      \ He raises his voice. “What, you think we’re not busy enough or\
      \ something? Beat it!” He mumbles about “blind birds” behind\
      \ your back as he escorts you out of the station."
    , "You know what you saw earlier that night. Frustrated, you\
      \ head back to the Ward Theatre to find some kind of proof you\
      \ can take to the police. You are surprised to find that the front\
      \ door of the theatre is locked. You are about to decide whether\
      \ or not to break down the door when you see a notice on the\
      \ wall near the entrance. “Don’t be a wet blanket! Come to The\
      \ King in Yellow cast party. 8pm, at the home of Constance\
      \ Dumaine, 1452 Atlantic Avenue. Formal dress only.” You\
      \ tear the notice from the wall and fold it into your coat pocket,\
      \ hoping it will lead you to the answers you seek."

    [ "You think about going to the police, but\
      \ considering the horrors in the theatre, they’re more likely to\
      \ think you’re mad than to believe your story. A small part of you\
      \ wonders if this is still some kind of prank, but that can’t be the\
      \ case—it was all too real, too terrifying to forget. Wondering\
      \ what course of action to take, you find yourself backtracking\
      \ over your escape route, returning to the theatre with cautious\
      \ steps. The bright glare of headlights drills into your eyes as cars\
      \ pass on the street, splashing dirty rainwater onto the sidewalk\
      \ beside you. Soon the Ward Theatre comes into sight, its bright\
      \ lights dominating the streets of Downtown. You expected\
      \ the theatre to be in ruins, but its exterior looks the same as it\
      \ did when you arrived to see The King in Yellow earlier that\
      \ night. You walk to the front window of the Ward Theatre and\
      \ tentatively peer through, but it is too dark to see anything inside."

      \ that you are being watched. You turn, and spot a shadow\
      \ fleeing around the corner. A swarm of roaches skitters across\
      \ the sidewalk, following in the shadow’s wake. Your muscles\
      \ tense with uncertainty, and you round the corner in pursuit.\
      \ Standing unconcerned on the sidewalk is a familiar-looking\
      \ man in a featureless pallid mask."
