      \ stopped a rampaging horror from tearing\
      \ through Dunwich, a backwater town several\
      \ hours north and west of Arkham. At first you\
      \ imagine this beast as a rabid bear, or worse, but\
      \ the professor’s description of the creature paints\
      \ a different picture."
    , "It all began when a man named Wilbur Whateley entered the Orne\
      \ Library looking for Olaus Wormius’s Latin translation of a book called\
      \ the Necronomicon. Wilbur already possessed a beaten-up English\
      \ translation by Dr. John Dee, but it was insufficient for his purposes.\
      \   Armitage turned the man away, fearing what use the strange man had\
      \ for the book. Whateley returned in secret, hoping to steal the book ,\
      \ but was attacked by a hound guarding the university. Armitage, Rice,\
      \ and Morgan later discovered Whateley’s body. A description of the foul\
      \ corpse—semi-anthropomorphic and covered in fur, with a leathery\
      \ hide and greenish-grey tentacles—causes you to question whether or\
      \ not Whateley was truly human."

      \ the university’s copy of the tome to Harold Walsted—the curator of\
      \ the Miskatonic Museum—for safekeeping in the museum’s Restricted\
      \ Hall. Although you are worried about your mentor, you are equally\

      \ imperative that we get our hands on that copy of the Necronomicon.\
      \ If my instincts are correct, the assailants you’ve encountered will be\
      \ searching for it. After all that transpired, I didn’t feel safe keeping it\
      \ at the library, so I brought it to my good friend, Harold Walsted. He is\
      \ the current curator of the Miskatonic Museum. I thought it would be\
      \ safe in the museum’s Restricted Hall, but now I’m not so sure. You must\
      \ retrieve it at all costs! I fear terribly what they could do with the rites\
      \ contained in its pages…”"
