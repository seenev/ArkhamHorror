    [ "Sunday, November 22nd, 1925. Arkham, Massachusetts."
    , "Though All Hallows’ Eve is nearly a month past, a grim melancholy lingers\
      \ throughout the town. Each morning, a thick fog permeates the streets. Nights\
      \ are beginning to grow longer, and if you ask around town, you’ll hear people\
      \ swear that it’s getting darker, too. But despite the gloomy mood, progress\
      \ continues in the sleepy town of Arkham. The election of Nathaniel Rhodes to the\
      \ United States Senate has upstanding members of the community feeling optimistic\
      \ about the town’s future. And tonight, at his well-appointed estate in French\
      \ Hill, a man named Josef Meiger hosts the Silver Twilight Lodge’s charity gala,\
      \ an annual members-only event that will turn deadly for several attendees..."

    [ "“Mr. Sanford, thank you so much for coming. I know you are a busy man. Your\
      \ presence at tonight’s meeting is very much appreciated.” Josef shakes Carl\
      \ Sanford’s hand firmly as he speaks. Sanford merely nods. “I know you’ve only\
      \ just arrived, but I have some...private matters to discuss with you, if that is\
      \ all right,” Josef continues, his narrow eyes shifting back and forth between\
      \ the men flanking Mr. Sanford."
    , "“Very well.” The elderly man nods to his two enforcers, who step aside to give\
      \ him privacy. He cradles his hands behind his back, his stature impressive for\
      \ his age. His discerning eyes fall on Josef. “What is the matter?”"
    , "Josef leans closer. “It’s here, sir. It’s here in this very house.”"
    , "There is a quiet pause between the two men, and then Carl Sanford smiles."
