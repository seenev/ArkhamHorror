      \ of the rainforest where Alejandro believes the Eztli once dwelled. The\
      \ jungle here is dense and untamed. The sky hides above the tree cover, but I\
      \ can tell from the crisp breeze that storm clouds are brewing overhead."
    , "The dangers of our expedition have been explained to us many times.\
      \ We are hundreds of miles away from any sign of civilization. Nobody in\
      \ modern times has yet to pierce the heart of these wilds. Until now, nobody\
      \ has had reason to try. After all, it wouldn’t make sense to find Aztec ruins\
      \ in this region of Mexico. And yet, here we are: looking for ruins that may\
      \ not exist in a place where, by all accounts, they should not."
    , "Already one of our surveyors has fallen ill, and another has been bitten by\
      \ a viper. I’m starting to think the rainforest doesn’t want us here. If this luck\
      \ persists, ours will be the shortest expedition in Miskatonic University’s\
      \ history. Tonight, we rest. Tomorrow, we venture into uncharted wilds."

      \ perilous than we could have possibly imagined. This may read like the ravings\
      \ of a lunatic, but I cannot explain it any other way. Being lost in the jungle\
      \ was no picnic, but that was the least of our worries. The rainforest was\
      \ guarded. Guarded by unfathomable horrors: serpentine creatures driven by anger\
      \ and hate, hunting us relentlessly."
    , "Perhaps just as deadly were the human natives of the rainforest. They appeared\
      \ to be Aztec warriors as far as dress and speech were concerned. Despite the\
      \ conquering of the Aztec people hundreds of years ago, these warriors somehow\
      \ survived. How they managed to remain undiscovered this long is beyond us. I\
      \ thought Alejandro would be excited to learn more about them, but he was more\
      \ disturbed than fascinated. I suppose he has a right to be incredulous. Nothing\
      \ about this expedition makes sense."
    , "The serpent creatures chased us for what seemed like days. Finally we were able\
      \ to find our way back to camp, but the price was steep. We had lost all progress\
      \ we had made, and many of us were injured or afflicted by serpent venom. We have\
      \ no choice but to send runners to the nearest city for additional supplies and\
      \ to wait and recover from our wounds."

      \ encountered in the wilds of the jungle. The rainforest was guarded. Guarded by\

      \ warrior named Ichtaca was particularly intriguing. We were able to defuse the\
      \ initial encounter with her, and surprisingly, she helped guide us through the\
      \ jungle, only to disappear mysteriously when we reached the ruins. I have a\
      \ feeling we have not seen the last of her."
    , "Alejandro did not agree with our decision to trust the Eztli warriors. He’s\
      \ decided to stay at camp until further notice, disturbed as he is by their\
      \ presence. I thought he would be excited to learn more about them, but I expect\
      \ this discovery defies even his broad-minded theories. I suppose he has a right\
      \ to be distrustful. Nothing about this expedition makes sense."
    , "We have cleared a route to what Alejandro believes is the main temple of the\
      \ ruins. There is little time to rest. The serpent creatures seem intent on\
      \ stopping us, so we cannot tarry any longer than necessary. Soon we will enter\
      \ the ruins to see what secrets they hide."
