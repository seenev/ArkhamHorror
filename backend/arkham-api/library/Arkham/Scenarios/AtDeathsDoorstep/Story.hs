      \ night of the annual Silver Twilight charity gala last Sunday. “We are\

      \ after the disappearances. “That said, we are confident that Sheriff Engle and\
      \ the Arkham Police will do their due diligence in finding the missing persons.”"

      \ Mizrah, Mr. Jerome Davids, Mr. Valentino Rivas, and Mrs. Penny White, all of\
      \ whom vanished halfway through the event and have not been seen since. The\
      \ police are offering a substantial reward for any person or persons who come\
      \ forward with information related to these disappearances. When asked whether\
      \ the police were considering the case a homicide, Sheriff Engle had this to say:\
      \ “There’s no reason to suspect foul play is involved just yet. However, given\
      \ the circumstances, we have to consider every possibility.” No other attendees\
      \ have come forward with statements concerning the gala, which seemed to finish\
      \ without a hitch despite the disappearances."

      \ recently moved to the same location: Josef Meiger’s estate in French Hill. “I\
      \ am certain that this event will be a smashing success,” Mr. Meiger told the\
      \ Arkham Advertiser in an interview yesterday. “There is no reason for the fair\
      \ residents of Arkham to worry.”"
