      \ void beyond. You dare not turn and look behind you, for you know that what\
      \ you see will likely break your heart, or perhaps your mind. Great polypous\
      \ horrors slide darkly amidst the blackness and loneliness of the cosmos. You\
      \ had hoped to marvel at a beautiful, glimmering array of stars, but instead\
      \ you are left with an empty pit in your stomach, as the unabated vastness of\
      \ the dark, cold universe looms before you. In the distance, a far-off melody\
      \ rings its chords, a melody you could not possibly recreate in your universe\
      \ with any known instrument, nor could your ears interpret its notes were it\
      \ not ringing in your head this very moment."
    , "There is a rush of air as you breach the turret of a nightmarish onyx\
      \ barrier and descend into an infinite cavern of black stone and impossible\
      \ architecture. The music grows as you plunge unswerving through an impossible\
      \ valley, through shoals of shapeless beings, and between things that lurk and\
      \ dance in the blackness beyond. You cannot help but listen to the strange\
      \ music, committing each terrible, dissonant note to memory. No thought or\
      \ dream of humanity can reach you here, in this place that was long ancient\
      \ when Earth was born. You can only hope to guide your steed to the place where\
      \ you must go... The throne upon which Azathoth itself sits."

      \ floor upon which to crash upon, but it never comes. You will still be\

      \ is still. At the center of the empty cosmos, the Blind Idiot God is lulled\
      \ to sleep once more. It dreams. Within its dream, a burst of cosmic energy\
      \ expands outward in all directions. A universe is born. Nebulae collapse and\
      \ become stars. New worlds are forged, and new beings evolve to inhabit them.\
      \ Inevitably, one learns of Azathoth. Its worship grows. In the end, all will\
      \ succumb to madness or join you in oblivion... For in the grand scheme of\
      \ fate, we are but specks of dust adrift in the aether, living only by the\
      \ whim of an uncaring cosmos."

      \ brief moment, the pipers’ song was interrupted, and Azathoth began to stir.\

      \ read your fortune. She knew the part you would have to play when you\

      \ essence from the witches’ cloaks, a fragment of spectral mist from the\
      \ wraiths you banished, and the knowledge you’ve gained from delving into\
      \ Arkham’s past. Slowly, quietly, you weave your wall together, stitching\
      \ darkness with blood, blood with souls, souls with onyx stone. It takes ages\
      \ to complete. When you are done, your reward is oblivion. A stillness and\
      \ silence so pure, so perfect, no disturbance can penetrate it. The barrier\
      \ cannot hold Azathoth—nothing truly can—but perhaps now it will not stir\
      \ when fools on Earth call forth its name or draw from its power. With your\
      \ task complete, you turn and face the darkness, summoning your steed. It is\
      \ time to go home."

      \ harm it would only risk stirring it. Desperate, you turn to Keziah’s Black\
      \ Book for answers. A quill appears in your hands as you open the tome, and a\
      \ voice from beyond reaches your ears. “Sign it with your blood. Take a new\
      \ secret name, and your desire shall become truth. You and your world will be\
      \ spared.” You know it is the voice of evil, the voice Walter Gilman heard\
      \ which surely led to his demise, the voice which seduced Keziah Mason and\
      \ led to this path in the first place...but what other choice to you have?"
