      \ lies off the northwestern coast of France. It is\
      \ beautiful, elegant, and enigmatic—a place out\
      \ of a fairy tale. Only this tale is one of horrors and\
      \ madness. During low tide, you would be able\
      \ to reach the island on foot by crossing the tidal\
      \ causeway that emerges from the sea. However,\
      \ by the time you reach the coast, the tide is much\
      \ higher than you’d anticipated. Dark clouds cover the sky, and a distant\
      \ crash of thunder signals the start of the oncoming storm. You find a\
      \ boat whose captain is willing to take you to the island, and prepare for\
      \ the ritual to come."

      \ and its haunting melody is ingrained in your mind. “Above the city the\
      \ storm clouds rage, and waves crash through the gilded cage… Below\
      \ the earth the salt water seeps, the shadows fall as the red sun sleeps…”\
      \ Studying the island that lies before you, illuminated by flashes of\
      \ lighting and assaulted by tumultuous waves, you can’t help but wonder\
      \ if Ashleigh was singing about this very moment."

      \ nor the screeching of winged horrors overhead. Somehow, you had escaped the\
      \ island’s certain doom. You creep to the door of the abbey and open it with\
      \ trepidation. A dazzling light sears your eyes, and you lift your hand to block\
      \ the glare of two suns. You stand overlooking the Lake of Hali. Black stars hang\
      \ in the heavens above. Beyond, over leagues of tossing cloud- waves, the towers\
      \ of Carcosa rise behind the shattered moon."
