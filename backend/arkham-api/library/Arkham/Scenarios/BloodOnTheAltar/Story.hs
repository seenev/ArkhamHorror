      \ another man from the village who had met with\
      \ Dr. Armitage during the incident several months\
      \ ago. “Things ain’t lookin’ too good here,” Earl\
      \ tells you. “Some folk up and went missin’ a few\
      \ nights ago. ‘Dem whippoorwills won’ shut up.\
      \ Dunno what yer doin’ here, but last time you Arkham folk came ‘round\
      \ it was bad news. Very bad news.” His eyes blink rapidly, and he coughs\
      \ and looks away."
    , "“Look, why don’t you rest fer the night an’ look fer whatever it is yer\
      \ looking fer t’morra,” Zebulon chimes in, putting a wrinkled hand on\
      \ your shoulder. You begin to protest, but your aching muscles and weary\
      \ mind won’t allow you to refuse. The elderly man offers to take you in\
      \ for the night, and drives you to his home at the outskirts of Dunwich\
      \ village. The town is disheveled and eerie, and you find yourself wishing\
      \ you hadn’t come here at all. You fall asleep on the ride over and scarcely\
      \ remember anything else from that night."
    , "When you awaken, you find that Zebulon’s house is abandoned, and\
      \ there is no sign of the elderly man, or of Mr. Sawyer. Fearing the worst,\
      \ you head into the village of Dunwich to investigate, hoping to find\
      \ answers."

      \ appendages, wriggling across the ground and climbing up the\
      \ walls. You’re so startled that you aren’t fast enough to prevent\

      \ With no time to spare, you recite the Latin incantation,\
      \ and find that the words come effortlessly to your tongue, as\
      \ though recalled from an earlier memory. The creature’s body\
      \ begins to shrink and melt away as the incantation builds, its\
      \ cries terrifying and haunting. In the end, all that is left is the\
      \ disfigured corpse of a man—Silas Bishop. You find a silver\
      \ pendant emblazoned with an odd constellation tucked into\
      \ his shirt. You take it with you, hoping to find a use for it."

      \ journal; many of its passages are written in Latin. It appears\
      \ to be a handwritten excerpt from the Necronomicon, its\
      \ purpose unknown. With no time to spare, you recite the\
      \ incantation, stumbling over the words and feeling your throat\
      \ tighten with each sentence. The creature’s body begins to\

      \ wet and sticky ichor, and a rotten stench."
