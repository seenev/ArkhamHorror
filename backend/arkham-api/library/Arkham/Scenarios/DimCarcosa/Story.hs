      \ gasping for air. You lie there for some time, utterly exhausted. Every muscle\
      \ in your body aches. Before you lies a desolate expanse of plain. In the\
      \ distance, the alien spires of a warped city rise into the clouds. Behind you,\
      \ the dark surface of the lake from which you’d emerged reflects the glare of two\
      \ suns. When you peer back into the murky depths, you see no sign of the chapel\
      \ where you’d made the leap, or of Mont Saint-Michel, or even of Earth. This is\
      \ Carcosa—the realm of madness in the stars, where Hastur reigns supreme."

      \ you lies a warped, alien city. Its twisting streets and aberrant architecture\
      \ have no semblance of order or structure. In the distance, a murky lake reflects\
      \ the glare of two suns. When you look up, the abbey of Mont Saint-Michel peeks\
      \ just below the clouds, flipped upside-down. This is Carcosa—the realm of\
      \ madness in the stars, where Hastur reigns supreme."

      \ warmth. You can scarcely bring yourself to look at it. You remember everything\
      \ now—how it all began, how it ended, and everything in between. There is only\
      \ one thing left to do. You hurl the mask into the air with all of your strength\
      \ and watch as it flies into the tempest-tossed waves below."

      \ feet, cheering endlessly. Several patrons in the front row are throwing roses\
      \ to the actors on stage, who are bowing with wide smiles across their faces. A\
      \ searing headache crawls through your temples. How did you get back here? Were\
      \ you in the theatre all along? What about the dinner party? The asylum? The\
      \ catacombs?... Carcosa? Was it all just a terrible dream?"
    , "You exit the auditorium before the crowd rushes to do the same. Dizziness and\
      \ exhaustion harries your senses. The weight of your lengthy investigation is\
      \ crushing your mind. By the time you finally reach the lobby, you are clawing\
      \ your way across the ground.  Just then, a man in an elegant suit reaches down\
      \ and grabs you by your arm, pulling you to your feet. You are about to thank him\
      \ when you realize who he is. The sight of him causes you to stagger backward in\
      \ horror momentarily. The actor who plays the role of the Stranger is still\
      \ wearing his pale, featureless mask. He gives you a wordless bow, then turns and\
      \ leaves through the Ward Theatre’s front entrance."

      \ creep to the door of the abbey and open it with trepidation. A dazzling light\
      \ sears your eyes, and you lift your hand to block the glare of the sun. You\
      \ stand overlooking beautiful Mont Saint-Michel. Seagulls fly over the abbey\
      \ under a backdrop of cloudless sky. The waters around the abbey are calm and\

      \ Saint-Michel stands at the edge of the steps, smiling at you. “Are you ready to\

      \ gone through in your attempt to save them. You warn them that he is coming to\

      \ stars on the wall of your cell, but the words become faded as the years go by.\
      \ Your warning is never heeded."
