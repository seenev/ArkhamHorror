      \ the remainder of the night, your thoughts drifting between concern and\
      \ disbelief. Her story is preposterous, but you feel compelled to believe it\
      \ nonetheless. You’ve known that the relic from the Eztli ruins had some deeper\
      \ purpose ever since you first laid eyes on it. When you emerge from your bedroom\
      \ the next morning, your uninvited guest is sitting at your dining-room table,\
      \ arms crossed tightly across her chest. Her piercing eyes trace your every move\
      \ like a bird watching its prey. No pleasantries are exchanged. “Where is the\
      \ relic now?” Ichtaca asks impatiently. “Where have you brought it?” You explain\
      \ that it is safe, in good hands. She shakes her head, her knuckles white with\
      \ frustration. “I assure you it is not.”"

      \ you after a short delay. Elli gives you an unusually curt greeting, her voice\
      \ cracking and unsteady. As soon as you ask about the relic, she scoffs. “Not\
      \ you, too! Mr. Walsted is practically knocking down my office door, and two\
      \ reporters have been harrassing me all morning!”"

      \ missing,” she explains. “None of the security guards knows what happened. One\
      \ minute it was in its display case; the next it was gone. And before you ask,\
      \ no, Mr. Vela is nowhere to be found.” Suddenly she is yelling to another party,\

      \ tales, although she refuses to explain where her people come from and how they\

      \ it.”"
