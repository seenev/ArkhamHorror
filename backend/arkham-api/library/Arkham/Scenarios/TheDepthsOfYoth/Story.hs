    [ "Several hours after you wake, your laborious descent pays dividends. The red\
      \ glow emanating from the bottom of the steps grows brighter with each step. The\
      \ stone floor finally levels off, and the choking tunnel walls open to reveal a\
      \ labyrinthine network of immense, far-reaching caverns. Littered throughout the\
      \ caverns are the ruins of a vast city, the likes of which you have never seen.\
      \ The elaborate stone architecture has been worn away by ages of abandonment, but\
      \ you sense that there is a history here that runs deeper than you can even\
      \ fathom. When you turn around to question Ichtaca, you notice a faint yellow\
      \ glow in her eyes, her pupils narrowed and contracted. “Yoth...the last refuge\
      \ of Valusia...” she quietly intones."
    , "Just then, a terrifying roar echoes throughout the cavern. The walls and floor\
      \ shake with tremendous force, and the red glow that permeates the area\
      \ brightens. A flood of hisses emerges from the tunnels all around you. Ichtaca\
      \ walks to the edge of a nearby precipice and looks out over the vast depths. “He\
      \ is here. I feel his presence. The Father of the Serpents..._Yig_.”"

    [ "You realize now that Ichtaca has her own agenda. Alejandro, as well—both have\
      \ been using you for their own ends, keeping you from the truth. You raise a\
      \ weapon and demand answers from her, catching her by surprise. “Yig demands the\
      \ relic be brought to the Nexus,” she responds anxiously. Her eyes glow brightly,\
      \ and her skin starts to scale over. Your eyes narrow, and you move to corner her\
      \ against the edge of the precipice, so she cannot escape. “The relic cannot be\
      \ trusted to the hands of Brotherhood: this much is true...For it is Valusia that\
      \ shall be restored to glory. Yig has called, and I must answer.” Before you can\
      \ react, she throws herself off the edge and into the depths below."

      \ deep breath and turns to face you. Her eyes are cast downward in shame, and\
      \ they have returned to their normal color. “I...I’m sorry. I have brought you to\
      \ your ruin. He called out to me, long ago, told me of my heritage, of my people.\
      \ I did his bidding willingly.” She clenches her fists, her gaze meeting yours.\
      \ “But now I realize I was wrong. Humanity deserves its time on Earth. You may\
      \ have inherited it from far more powerful forces, but it is humanity’s time, not\
      \ theirs.” You don’t completely understand what she is saying, but you understand\
      \ the implication. Whatever Ichtaca truly is, she is on your side. A calm silence\
      \ lingers between you, an unspoken bond that joins you as one. “We must get to\
      \ the Nexus and prevent the serpents from recovering the relic,” she explains\
      \ after a few moments, breaking the silence. You nod in agreement."

      \ she led you here? Before you have the chance to react, she draws her bow and\
      \ aims an arrow at your heart. “Thank you for aiding me this far,” Ichtaca says\
      \ curtly, “but the time has come for us to part ways. Yig has called, and I must\
      \ answer.” Her yellow eyes narrow and shine brightly."

      \ We cannot let you or the Brotherhood foil our plans. Not now, not when we are\
      \ so close.” Her hand wavers for a moment, and her eyes flicker again. You can\
      \ tell that something is tearing at her, weighing on her mind. Finally, she\
      \ speaks again. “Go now. Before I change my mind. And if you wish to live, do not\
      \ follow. I will not give you a second chance.” Ichtaca swiftly departs, eyes\

      \ seen her skill with a bow—with her steady aim, you would be dead before you\
      \ took two steps. You have no choice but to comply. Your weapons clatter to the\
      \ ground, one at a time. “Good. Now the relic: hand it to me.” Grimacing, you\

      \ across her forearm. Blood sprays across your chest, and she staggers with pain,\
      \ gripping her arm. Her heel clips a rock near the edge of the precipice, and she\
      \ tumbles over the side of the ledge, her scream growing distant as she falls.\
      \ You barely have time to recover from the shock of what just happened, as\

      \ depths, the serpents chasing you are hot on your tail. You are intruders in\
      \ their home, and they know these hellish tunnels better than you. With your\
      \ wounds slowing you down and panic seeping into every one of your decisions,\
      \ your death at the hands of these creatures is inevitable. Despair worms its way\
      \ into your mind. When the serpents inevitably catch up to you, you are crossing\

      \ Serpent creatures on both sides of the chasm flank you, spear tips corralling\
      \ you against the precarious edge of the bridge. A small hunk of stone cracks at\
      \ your heel and detaches, falling into the inky void below. You do not hear it\
      \ strike the floor of the chasm. There is no hope to escape or flee this time—you\
