    [ "It is a breezy November evening in Arkham—the perfect night for a walk through\
      \ Independence Square, or so you had thought, up until the moment Anna Kaslow\
      \ offered to tell your fortune. You agreed, though you would soon come to regret\
      \ this decision. For each of the cards the Romani soothsayer draws from her deck,\
      \ she weaves a tale of despair and misfortune.  Judgment. Temperance. Justice.\
      \ The Hermit. The Hanged Man. The Hierophant. The Lovers. The Chariot. The Wheel\
      \ of Fortune. To complete her tale, Anna draws the top card and lays it in the\
      \ center of the formation. Dominating the old, worn card is the ominous image of\
      \ a towering construct of black onyx. A hellish storm rages over the tower,\
      \ lightning coursing through the dark clouds. It reads: THE TOWER · XVI. Even if\
      \ the rest of the reading had gone swimmingly, the sight of the center card would\
      \ have sent a shiver down your spine. As it stands now, it feels more like the\
      \ closing of a casket over your body."
    , "“You did tell me to give it to you straight,” the soothsayer says. She sits\
      \ cross-legged in front of you, wearing a stony, grim expression. From her\
      \ unwavering gaze and her cold eyes, you can tell Anna derives no satisfaction\
      \ from this reading. “Simple misfortune is the least of your concerns,” she\
      \ explains. “This is a matter of life and death.” She motions to the cards\
      \ surrounding The Tower—each of them laid in the reverse position—and stares at\
      \ them intently. “Arrayed against you is everything that you cannot see. You\
      \ alone stand in their way,” she says enigmatically."

    [ "The woman nods and draws the top card of the deck with a steady hand, revealing\
      \ it to you without looking at it herself. Depicted on the card is a single\
      \ wooden wand, surrounded by a pattern of broken stained glass. It reads: ACE OF\
      \ RODS. “You must be ready to act,” she advises. “Without hesitation. Without\
      \ regret. When the opportunity arises, you must set into motion the events that\
      \ will change this fate.”"

    [ "The woman smirks. “Yes, in a sense, I suppose it is,” she responds. With a\
      \ single swift motion, she picks up each of the cards displayed before you, save\
      \ for The Tower card, and shuffles them back into the deck. “The cards only\
      \ reveal and advise. They cannot influence or impose.” She locks eyes with you,\
      \ and her smile vanishes from her face. “In other words, though your fate is not\
      \ set in stone, I assure you the danger you face is not ‘bullshit.’ It is real.”\
      \ Her eyes narrow. “It is very real.”"

    [ "Silence hangs in the air as you peer into The Tower card. The world around you\
      \ dissolves into emptiness as your eyes fixate on the onyx tower. Rolling thunder\
      \ echoes in the distance. “Do you understand now?” Anna asks. There is no other\
      \ sign of the soothsayer: only her strained voice. A bolt of lightning streaks\
      \ across the sky. “Do you see your fate before you, as I do?”"
    , "Another resounding crack of thunder, and you are suddenly awake. Icy rain pelts\
      \ your body, soaking you through to the bone. You are lying in the mud beside a\
      \ wooded trail, and there is no other soul in sight..."

    [ "Despite her wounds, the leader of the coven rises to her feet. More of the\
      \ hooded figures emerge from the tree line, eager to defend their leader.\
      \ “Interloper!” one calls you, pulling off her hood and pointing a gnarled wooden\
      \ rod in your direction. Her bright-red hair glows in the firelight, embers\
      \ dancing about her extended hand. “They’re the ones from before, High Priestess:\
      \ the ones who interfered with our great work.”"
    , "The “High Priestess” holds up a single hand, and a hush falls over the other\
      \ witches. “As always, I admire your perseverance, sister. But I do not believe\
      \ these are the ones you speak of,” she replies to the red-haired accuser. You\
      \ lower your weapons as several of the hooded figures approach and surround their\
      \ leader. They begin chanting in a soft tone as they examine her wounds. The\
      \ red-haired witch crosses her arms and watches you with a hard glare, her gaze\
      \ never straying far from you.  “I am Anette,” says the leader of the coven, “and\
      \ these are my sisters. Tell me: Who are you, and why are you here?”"
    , "You explain how you awoke in the woods, how you were attacked by terrible\
      \ creatures, and how you came to the center of this circle in order to break the\
      \ spell surrounding the woods. Anette’s eyes narrow as she hears your story.\
      \ “That is impossible. The circle was closed. None could enter the woods while we\
      \ were completing our spell.” She grits her teeth. “You must go at once. This is\
      \ not your place.”"
    , "“But, High Priestess!—” the red-haired witch exclaims, only to be interrupted\
      \ by Anette’s gaze. The two lock eyes, a battle of wills that quickly proves\
      \ Anette victorious."
    , "“Stand down, Erynn,” Anette says with a firm, motherly tone, as though\
      \ admonishing a child. She turns her attention back to you as the witch named\
      \ Erynn lowers her head in defeat. “Go. You’ve broken the spell, just as you\
      \ desired. You can leave the woods now. But I give you one final warning: cross\
      \ us again, and we will not be so merciful.”"
    , "You begin to protest, but before you are able to utter a single word, a dark\
      \ gale snuffs out the fire at the center of the clearing. Shadows from beyond the\
      \ tree line suddenly twist and coil into the clearing, tugging at the edges of\
      \ the witches’ cloaks. One by one, the shadows twist and pull each of the witches\
      \ into the darkness beyond. In moments, they are gone. You are left with only the\
      \ soft glow of moonlight to guide you home."
