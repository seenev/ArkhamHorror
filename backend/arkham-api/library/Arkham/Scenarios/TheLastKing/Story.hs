      \ the manor. There is no doubt in your mind that the cast and\
      \ crew of The King in Yellow have become affected by madness.\
      \ Perhaps it’s getting to you, as well. You feel an encroaching\
      \ darkness, a presence in your mind not unlike the gaze of the\
      \ Stranger. Startled, you peer about the front yard for the first\
      \ time since escaping the manor. The scene is…different. The\
      \ front windows are not smashed as they were when you first\
      \ approached. The trail of blood you had noticed on the porch\
      \ has been wiped clean, and instead of the disturbingly warped\
      \ music you had heard upon entering, the soothing tones of slow\
      \ jazz drift out from the courtyard."

      \ that you are sitting on a couch in the manor’s living room, and\
      \ that you have been asleep for some time. The party appears to\
      \ be winding down. No music fills the halls, the food is all but\
      \ gone, and only a few guests remain. “Perhaps you would like\
      \ for me to get your coat?” the server asks with a trained smile.\
      \ You wobble as you rise to your feet, leaning against the couch’s\
      \ armrest. Your head pounds with a dizzying intensity, and\
      \ your vision is spotted. You insist that you are fine, and begin\
      \ walking toward the foyer."

      \ earlier, not even the hostess, Mrs. Dumaine. All traces of\
      \ the madness and horror you’ve experienced are gone. Even\
      \ the oddities you witnessed upon entering the manor have\
      \ vanished—the signs of struggle, the broken windows, the\
      \ blood trail on the porch… Every piece of evidence has been\
      \ erased. But you still remember the night’s events, and in your\
      \ memory you will find your answers."

      \ Avenue. What a roaring good time you had! And yet, your\
      \ memory is hazy. You can’t help but feel you are forgetting\
      \ something important. Something about the play you’d\
      \ watched earlier that night—The King in Yellow. That\
      \ nagging sensation pursues you in every waking moment. Try\
      \ as you might to recall the night’s events in full, there remains\
      \ a gaping hole in your memory. As you strain to remember,\
      \ your concern grows, almost to the point of obsession. Deciding\
      \ that you absolutely must know what occurred that night,\
      \ you head toward the manor of the Historical Society in\
      \ Southside. Perhaps there you can learn more about The King\
      \ in Yellow play…"
