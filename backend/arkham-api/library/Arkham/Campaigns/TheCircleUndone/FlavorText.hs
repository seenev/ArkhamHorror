    [ "Sunday, November 22nd, 1925. Arkham, Massachusetts."
    , "Though All Hallows’ Eve is nearly a month past, a grim melancholy lingers\
      \ throughout the town. Each morning, a thick fog permeates the streets. Nights\
      \ are beginning to grow longer, and if you ask around town, you’ll hear people\
      \ swear that it’s getting darker, too. But despite the gloomy mood, progress\
      \ continues in the sleepy town of Arkham. The election of Nathaniel Rhodes to the\
      \ United States Senate has upstanding members of the community feeling optimistic\
      \ about the town’s future. And tonight, at his well-appointed estate in French\
      \ Hill, a man named Josef Meiger hosts the Silver Twilight Lodge’s charity gala,\
      \ an annual members-only event that will turn deadly for several attendees..."

      \ a toast. A hush descends on the room, until only the crackle of the fireplace\
      \ and whispers of gossip can be heard. “Allow me to welcome you all into my home\
      \ for this year’s charity gala. We have some very upstanding citizens here\
      \ tonight, and I thank all of you for your hard work and generosity.” Cheers and\
      \ murmurs of agreement fill the room. Many of the guests raise their glasses to\
      \ Valentino, one of the most esteemed members of the Lodge this year, who sits at\
      \ the Guest of Honor table, which is nearest to the fireplace."
    , "Josef ’s assistant, Jerome, blends into the wall behind Josef, discreetly\
      \ checking his pocket watch. In another corner of the room, the head housekeeper,\
      \ Penny, walks from table to table, filling empty glasses and collecting dirty\
      \ salad plates. “Each of you has done great deeds in the name of the Silver\
      \ Twilight Lodge and our historic city,” Josef continues. “Next year, we will\
      \ continue to shoulder this burden and do what must be done for the sake of\
      \ progress.” Jerome steps forward quietly, interrupting Josef ’s speech with the\
      \ unassuming confidence that comes from years of trusted service. He taps Josef\
      \ lightly on his shoulder and shows him the time. “I’m afraid I am already out of\
      \ time. Thank you all very much for attending,” Josef concludes, bowing. Polite\
      \ applause rises from the audience, and Josef walks briskly toward the parlor,\
      \ followed closely by his assistant. Two servants collect coats as latecomers\
      \ trickle into the manor, and Gavriella—Josef ’s head of security—watches over\
      \ the entrance with hard eyes and a clenched jaw. “Has Mr. Sanford arrived?”\
      \ Josef asks curtly, tapping his polished leather shoe on the floor."
    , "“I’m afraid not,” Jerome replies, flipping through the last pages of the\
      \ estate’s guest book. “But he should be here any minute, Mr. Meiger.”"
    , "“Good. I want there to be no problems whatsoever when he arrives; am I\
      \ understood?” Josef calls out to Gavriella: “Make sure he is well protected.”\
      \ Gavriella nods, patting the handle of her .45 in her shoulder holster. Josef\
      \ turns his attention back to his assistant. “And have Penny make sure the main\
      \ course is kept good and hot while we wait for Mr. Sanford’s arrival. Not a\
      \ single slice is to be served without his presence.”"
    , "“Not even for Mr. Rivas, sir?” Jerome asks, glancing at Josef over the rim of\
      \ his thick glasses. Josef pauses for a moment, considering."
    , "“Pour Mr. Rivas another glass of champagne, and I am sure he will not complain.\
      \ Also, I’m still waiting on those accounts I asked you about earlier today.\
      \ Don’t forget,” Josef says, clapping his assistant on the shoulder before\
      \ walking back into the banquet hall. Jerome nods obediently and heads upstairs."
    , "Soon after, the dark mist would appear, and nothing would be the same."

      \ mist crawling over the carpet in its wake.  “I warned you,” you growl, and a\
      \ thunderous shot echoes through the parlor as you squeeze the trigger. The\
      \ bullet rips a hole in the figure’s head like a rush of air billowing through a\
      \ column of smoke. The mist stitches itself together, and the thing continues to\
      \ drift your way, reaching out menacingly."
