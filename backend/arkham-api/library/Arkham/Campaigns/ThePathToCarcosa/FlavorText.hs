      \ rehearsal. You couldn’t help but note the blank, dismissive expressions\
      \ on many of the audience members’ faces, and you wonder how the\
      \ audience will react to the play’s disturbing second half. The role of\
      \ Cassilda is tiresomely boring for the first half of the play, although\
      \ you enjoy portraying her regal charm. You find yourself missing your\
      \ previous co-star, Miriam Twain, and suddenly the dread and regret you\
      \ had felt in Paris comes flooding back. With a sigh, you retreat to a dark\
      \ corner backstage to escape the sounds of stagehands preparing for the\
      \ next scene. You try to quell your emotions and replace your thoughts\
      \ with those of Cassilda’s—her hopes, her fears, her fate."

      \ to replace the actor who plays the Stranger before each show (and\
      \ indeed many times during rehearsals), you know that this last-minute\
      \ replacement is the most horrid of them all. Realizing you never caught\
      \ his name, a shiver of terror courses through your spine. Have you found\
      \ your way back to the wolves, like a lost lamb? You cannot look away—\
      \ his gaze is inescapable. Everything goes black."

      \ Yellow,” it reads. “A special one-night engagement at Arkham’s very\
      \ own Ward Theatre. An irresistible drama in two acts. Production staged\
      \ and directed by Nigel Engram.” The cast is a small ensemble, with one\
      \ unattributed credit at the end: “The Stranger.”"
    , "To have such a highly anticipated play come to Arkham all the way\
      \ from Paris is a noteworthy event, even if it is just for one night. For\
      \ weeks leading up to the show, it was the talk of the town. It seemed\
      \ so unassuming…and yet, you have evidence something sinister is at\
      \ work. It started with the disappearance of one of the stagehands at the\
      \ theatre—a boy of only seventeen who missed rehearsal one night and\
      \ was never seen again. Then, less than two weeks before the performance,\
      \ there was the musician whose corpse was found with a gun in its mouth.\
      \ Perhaps most chilling was the crazed man the coppers had picked up\
      \ in Independence Square who had been ranting and raving about the\
      \ “King’s return.” He was brought to Arkham Asylum, and you were\
      \ surprised to discover that he was not alone in his delusions."
    , "Finding these events suspicious, you and your companions have delved\
      \ deeper into the matter. Although no connection can be proven, these\
      \ weren’t the only strange events surrounding the up-and-coming play.\
      \ Instances of suicide and madness have followed in its wake, and you are\
      \ determined to discover why."
    , "The lights in the auditorium dim, and a spotlight shines on the\
      \ stage. What unfolds is not quite what you expected. Slow-paced\
      \ and monotonous, the first act of The King in Yellow is a tedious\
      \ bore. The setting and characters are compelling, but the meandering\
      \ and nonsensical story does little to entertain or inform. You begin\
      \ to wonder whether the dreadful events surrounding The King in\
      \ Yellow aren’t connected, after all. Perhaps it was just your overactive\
      \ imagination; how could such a trivial and unassuming show cause such\
      \ pandemonium? You are surprised when the first act closes without any\
      \ rising action or revelation. The lights rise for the intermission, and you\
      \ consider leaving early, stifling a yawn. Before you are able to decide,\
      \ however, you find yourself drifting…drifting…to sleep."
