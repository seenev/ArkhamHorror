-- Discard cards from hand, lose resources, lose actions, take damage, or take horror.
--
-- So given the windows we need to figure out what is valid to ignore, and let
-- the player choose if multiple, we then push an effect for the current window
-- that targets that card, the aspect needs to be handled by the investigator,
-- or alternatively we remove the messages entirely, since this is a when, it
-- should be queued up, however we need to prequeue which is weird...
